# Keyboardio Model 01 Firmware

The firmware of Colemak user Arley McBlain for the [Model 01](http://keyboard.io).

### Inspiration 

- [Community Forum](http://community.keyboard.io)
- [Algernon's Firmware](https://github.com/algernon/Model01-sketch)
- [Hyper key - from A Modern Space Cadet](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/#hyper)

### Failed experiments

Not every setting I try has been good, I want to keep track of a couple and why they fail.

- OneShot alt was too error prone for me; mis-hit when going for space, accidentally double hit for triggering alfred making it sticky
- Swapping bksp with cmd and space with alt was ok, but they are in great spots, obviously Jesse and Kaia put a lot of thought into the defaults
- On a previous board with Karabiner Elements I tried DualUse for left and right shift keys being parensâ€“such a great idea, but in reality I'm still a bit sloppy a typer; I would hit shift in anticipation of modifying a key, but change my mind-and leave a bracket behind!
